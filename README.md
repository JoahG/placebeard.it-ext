# placebeard.it extension

replace all the photos with beards.

---

Inspired by the [nCage extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ncage/hnbmfljfohghaepamnfokgggaejlmfol?hl=en), this extension does exactly what it says it's going to do: replaces all the images with beards from [placebeard.it](http://placebeard.it) (built by @[ry4nolson](https://github.com/ry4nolson)).
